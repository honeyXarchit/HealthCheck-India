            <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
                <li>The origin of the right to health dates as far back as 1946 when the first international organization, World Health Organisation (WHO) came into existence to formulate health terms as human rights.</li>
                <li>Healthcare is indispensable globally as it not only saves lives and boosts productivity but also fosters social stability, drives innovation, and promotes overall well-being, making it an essential cornerstone for human progress and prosperity.</li>

        <span>
            <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
                <li>Affordability: Healthcare expenses can be catastrophic for many families, particularly those living below the poverty line.</li>
                <li>Infrastructure: Rural areas often lack basic healthcare infrastructure such as hospitals, clinics, and qualified healthcare professionals.</li>
                <li>Quality of Care: While some urban areas boast world-class hospitals and specialized medical care, rural areas often have understaffed and poorly equipped healthcare centers.</li>
                <li>Healthcare Workforce: This shortage is particularly acute in rural areas, where healthcare workers are less inclined to practice due to lower salaries, lack of facilities, and other challenges.</li>
                <li>Healthcare Financing: India's healthcare financing mechanisms are inadequate, with limited public spending on healthcare as a percentage of GDP.</li>
                <li>Financial constraints and health insurance-Health insurance in India is not as widespread as in some other countries. This can lead to delayed or avoided treatments, causing further complications and health issues.</li>
                <li>Growing burden of non-communicable and communicable diseases-Antimicrobial resistance is one of the biggest health challenges facing humanity that must be tackled with all seriousness. In addition, non-communicable diseases or NCDs are now the leading cause of death in the country, contributing to 60% of deaths. </li>

                    How can we Enhance Healthcare Services in India?

                <span>
                    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
                    <li>Investment in Infrastructure: Expanding and modernizing healthcare infrastructure, especially in rural areas, can improve access to healthcare services for a larger portion of the population.</li>
                    <li>Telemedicine: Leveraging technology to provide remote medical consultations can help reach underserved populations in remote areas and reduce the burden on urban healthcare facilities.</li>
                    <li>Health Education and Awareness: Promoting health education and awareness campaigns can empower individuals to make healthier lifestyle choices and seek appropriate medical care when needed.</li>
                    <li>Preventive Healthcare: Emphasizing preventive healthcare measures such as vaccinations, screenings, and regular check-ups can help reduce the prevalence of diseases and lower healthcare costs in the long run.</li>
                    <li>Public-Private Partnerships (PPP): Collaborating with private sector entities can help improve the efficiency and quality of healthcare services, especially in areas where government resources are limited.</li>
                    <li>Affordable Medicines: Implementing policies to reduce the cost of essential medicines and making them more accessible.</li>
                    <li>Focus on Primary Care: Strengthening primary healthcare services by increasing the number of primary care facilities and training healthcare workers can ensure that basic medical needs are addressed effectively at the grassroots level.</li>
